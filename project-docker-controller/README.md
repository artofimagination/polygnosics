# Project docker controller
This controller is responsible to start docker containers required for a project.
Project containers
  - turn server (server and maria db container) See https://github.com/coturn/coturn
  - project container
  
## How it works?
The controller is part of the main platform. On user request the following will happen:
  1. the platform starts the turn server
  2. starts the project
  3. the platform sends a webRTC offer to the project relayed by the turn server
  4. if the turn server authentication is successful the project sends back an answer and the webRTC between the platform and the project will be online
  
## Turn server (Using open source Coturn: https://github.com/coturn/coturn)
- The turn server is using long term credentials for identification. These credentials shall be generated by the platform during the container creation process.
- WebRTC is through TLS. Certificates can be generated by generatCerts.sh, they have to be copied to a preset location for the platform, the project and the turn server
- The platform is using pion webrtc implementation https://github.com/pion/webrtc

## Known issues
Using `ICETransportPolicyRelay` transport policy does not work. No messages are arriving through the webrtc data channel. See [Issue#14](https://github.com/artofimagination/polygnosics/issues/14)
